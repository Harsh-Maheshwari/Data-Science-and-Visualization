Customer Retention analysis is critical for a good marketing and a
customer relationship management strategy. An important component
of this strategy is the customer retention rate. Customer retention 
rate has a strong impact on the customer lifetime value, and understanding
the true value of a possible customer churn will help the company in
its customer relationship management. Conventional statisticalmethods 
are very successful in predicting a customer churn. This project predicts
churn using various supervised classification methods and analyze the
churning and no-churning customers by using data

 contain the single HTML web page used in our app.
